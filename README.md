## How to run the tests

Using windows

- Install NodeJs (https://nodejs.org/en/download)

- Install Cypress, Run cmd.
```cmd
npm install cypress --save -dev
```

- Download this REPO

- Enter in the folder

- Call cypress to run all tests (headless mode)

```cmd
npx cypress run
```

- You can see the videos in the folder `cypress/videos/`

## Assumptions

- I assume that the first book on the search is the best match

- "A quinta dos animais" doesn't exist with this name in portuguese, so I used "O triunfo dos Porcos" (it's the same book)
